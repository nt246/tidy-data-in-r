# (10) Automation, Part II

--- LAST YEAR'S CONTENT BELOW ---

## Review

Last time, we saw:

- Running R scripts using R, vs using the terminal
- Running Rmd scripts using R, vs using the terminal
- Makefile "rule" structure
- Running `make`

The three LOTR pipelines acted as a proof of concept.

Today, we'll make our own Makefile and pipeline.

## `make` pipeline activity

We'll follow along with [Shaun and Jenny's `make` tutorial](http://stat545.com/automation04_make-activity.html).
